                <p>You hold such a special place in my life, one that no one could ever replace. I am truly grateful to have you. I’m sorry for the times I’ve made you cry—I promise to try harder not to hurt you anymore. and Grateful for every memory we’ve made together. Over these past four years, you’ve always remained the same caring, loving, and supportive person I admire so much. Thank you for always being there for me, guiding me, and showing unwavering support.</p>
